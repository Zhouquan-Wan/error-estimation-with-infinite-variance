This repository contains a single Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to estimate confidence intervals for heavy-tailed distributions using:

- **Tail-aware rescaling method** (with known stable law parameters)
- **m-out-of-n bootstrap** (without tail knowledge)

[ðŸ“„ View the notebook](./error_estimation_with_infinite_variance.ipynb)

**To run locally:**
You only need the following Python packages:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `jupyter`
